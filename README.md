##Visualization parameters:
Number of particles: 3000
With a stroke weight of 3, 3000 particles shows enough particle to get an understanding of the vector field. 

Particle lifetime: 200
A lifetime of 200 gives enough time for particles to get stuck in some of the vortices or points where the wind vectors are near zero. A smaller lifetime is not enough time for particles to get trapped in these features and thus does not appropriately portray the vector field. A greater lifetime leads to too much visual clutter to see where the particles are heading. 

Step size:

##Discussion of step size:
The step size affects the speed of the particles. The step size affects the precision of the integration. A very low step size will yield a better, more realistic result since the integration is performed at finer intervals. When evaluating an integral in calculus, the step size is infinitesimal and the results obtained are thus exact. 


##For lack of time, no wizardly work was completed.
